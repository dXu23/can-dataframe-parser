Week II mini-project
----------------------------

With your deeper understanding of ECU and system architecture, include the concepts of a comunication protocol
in your mini-project for the week. Use Python to write the logic that an ECU might use to accept and analyze
sensor data, and then prepare output data. 
Since we will not be connecting our applications to other systems, we will use a text formatted file to produce
the input sensor data, and output data should be written to a second output file following the format outlined
below.
Your program should also log important events to a separate log file.


Using Python:
- Read the input data frames from a target file
- Analyze each frame in sequence, using an appropriate conversion factor for the sensor to convert
    the frames to a meaningful value
- Write the frame number, the name of the sensor, their converted data value and unit,
    and if an error was detected to the output file.
- Log the number of input data frames analyzed, the number of errors detected in the input data frames,
    and what DTC are generated as a result of those errors to a third file.



Input Data Frame Format
----------------------------
Input frames will contain:
- 1 two-digit hexadecimal value noting the sensor producing the data
- 3 two-digit hexadecimal values with the data produced by the sensor
- 1 two-digit hexadecimal value noting if an error was detected

Input data frames fill match the following format:
----------------------------
sensor | data A | data B | data C | error
  0x   |   0x   |   0x   |   0x   |   0x


Sample input data frame
----------------------------
0d 00 00 32 00
0a 0e 00 00 0f
01 2c 73 39 ff


Errors
The following error codes may be included with an input data frame. Each code should be handled according to the 
conditions listed in this section.
----------------------------
00 - no error
0f - single event
ff - major malfunction

- If no error is detected the data should be converted as normal and no additional action should be taken.
- If a major malfunction is detected the data should be excluded and a DTC should be noted in the log file
- If a sensor produces a single event error the data should be included if it is within the value range,
    and a count of the errors started. If three or more input data frames in sequence that carry a single
    event error, a DTC should be noted in the log file.


Sensors
The following sensors may be included in the input data frames. Your Python code should be able to
convert any of the input data frames to a meaningful value using the conversion for that sensor,
and include an appropriate unit in the output file.
----------------------------
sensor code | sensor name                | value conversion | value unit | value range
0a          | fuel pressure              | (3A)             | kPa        | 0 - 765
0c          | engine speed               | ((256A + B)/4)   | rpm        | 0 - 16,383.75
0d          | vehicle speed              | (C)              | km/h       | 0 - 255
11          | throttle position          | ((100/255)A)     | %          | 0 - 100
2f          | fuel tank level            | ((100/255)A)     | %          | 0 - 100
5c          | oil temperature            | (A-40)           | C          | -40 - 215
67          | engine coolant temperature | (B-40)           | C          | -40 - 215
68          | air intake temperature     | (C-40)           | C          | -40 - 215


Output Data Format
----------------------------
The output data file should include all of the important information from the input data frames, in a 
human-readable format. Each input data frame should be represented by a line in the output data.
Each line of output data should include:
- The number of the frame
- A time stamp
- The sensor name
- The converted data
- The unit for the converted data
- The DTC if one is required for the frame


Output Data Example
----------------------------

input data frames:
0d 00 00 32 00
68 00 00 f0 0f
0c ff 00 88 ff

output data file:
1 - 14:35:45 - vehicle speed - 50 km/h
2 - 14:35:46 - air intake temperature - 200 C
3 - 14:35:47 - engine speed - DTC - P0725
